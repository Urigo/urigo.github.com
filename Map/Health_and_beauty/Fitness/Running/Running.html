As an Asthma patient running for is the best sports for me.
</br>

Shockingly now, after continuously practicing for a year, i feel no effects of Asthma on body no more.
</br>
And i feel gratefull about that.

It important to make the running routine as versatile as possible.
</br>
Also the best impact for Asthma patients is very intens and fast running workouts.
</br>

A large trend today is to run barfoot.
