<p><strong>How to learn better?</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Teach what you want to learn - the best way to really learn is to teach it. find someone who want&#39;s to learn that thing and then teach him. (you can upload and share you&#39;r lessons online later if you want like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM95HHI4gLk">Salman Khan did..</a>)</li>
    <li>Understand every word. don&#39;t move on - The first thing they teach you in school is that if you don;t understand, continue reading and you will understand it later with the context.&nbsp;that&#39;s a bad thing! the context a lot of the time is changed with that particular word or subject you thought was one thing and it was actually another. don&#39;t put holes in your learning curve. stop, wait, know, move on.</li>
    <li>Learn english - Extremely important. good resources and technics anyone?</li>
