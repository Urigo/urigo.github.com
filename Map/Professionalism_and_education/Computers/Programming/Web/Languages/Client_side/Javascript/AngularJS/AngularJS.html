<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is the best javascript framework there is!
Start by going through the <a href="http://angularjs.org/">official page</a>.

Start with the tutorial,
then continue to the developers guide and then to the API reference.
Through there you can (and should) subscribe to the:
Blog
Youtube channel
Mailling list

After all of that you should go through all the rest of the resources, they are really good.

One of the best things about AngularJS is it's community, so use it!
ask questions and check for solutions in the mailing list and google search, don't invent something that is already invented..

The next place you need the look in is <a href="http://angular-ui.github.com/">AngularUI</a>.
