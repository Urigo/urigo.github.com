One of the Apress books for your foundation iOS SDK learning: Beginning iPhone Development: Exploring the iPhone SDK by Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche ramps up very well for a beginner and covers most of what you'd need to know to make a complete application from design to delivery.
And finally The iPhone Developer's Cookbook by Erica Sadun for additional badassery. I learned more from Erica's book than any other source. If you only buy one book, BUY THIS ONE. It's awesome, provides insane code source, loads of workarounds and useful helper classes and hacks.

CIMG. Loads of great topics and tips.
Find the authors of these books on Twitter and follow them. Seriously, they post sample code, tips, and will help you directly. I've found it invaluable.
