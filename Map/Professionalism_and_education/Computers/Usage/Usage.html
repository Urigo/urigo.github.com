        <h2>Surfing the internet</h2>
        <p>
            The best web browser to use is without question <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Email</h2>
        <p>
            Use <a href="https://mail.google.com">Gmail</a>.
            It is extremely safe and spam free.
            It also let's you use your email from everywhere in the world and from any device.

        <h2>Documents</h2>
        <p>
            Use <a href="drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>.
            Microsoft Office used to be the best and the standard.
            That's not true anymore. Google Drive is free and let you use it everywhere on any device and also backup your files automatically.
            You can also share the documents easily and work on them simultaneously with a friend.
